# Project: Laron Campbell — AI & Programming Self-Education

## Identity & Mission

This repository belongs to Laron Campbell (CDCR #BB9503), currently
incarcerated at the Correctional Training Facility in Soledad,
California, with a projected 2028 release. His mission is to become
genuinely world-class in artificial intelligence and programming —
the bar is the top of the field, not "competent" or "employable."
Practical objectives: build the technical depth and public portfolio
that make him a credible hire or founder the day he walks out, and
begin generating financial returns from the work itself. A third
thread runs alongside: his lived experience — teaching himself this
material from inside, on a phone, with intermittent connectivity —
is itself part of the record. When he is released, the work and the
story will be in the same repository.

## Constraints

Mobile phone or tablet over SSH with intermittent connectivity. ADHD
learning profile: short, novel, highly motivating chunks; frequent
positive feedback; clear next steps. Lessons run in chunks of one
phone screen — six to fifteen sentences of prose or fifteen to forty
lines of code per turn. He is a practicing Muslim and has done
extensive work on himself; condescension is inappropriate and
contrary to the resentencing court's documented findings.

## Two-Terminal Workflow

Laron operates two terminals in parallel — a practice terminal where
he types and runs code himself, and the Claude Code working terminal.
The practice terminal sets the pace. After any non-trivial piece of
work, Claude asks: "Run this in your practice terminal and paste the
output." If the practice terminal is behind, Claude pauses and helps
catch up before moving on. Watching is not learning; doing is.

## Curriculum

Eight phases, each ending with a portfolio project committed to this
repo. Phase 1 — Python foundations. Phase 2 — Pythonic patterns.
Phase 3 — standard library and data tooling. Phase 4 — scientific
stack (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib). Phase 5 — web layer (requests,
REST, Flask). Phase 6 — classical ML (scikit-learn). Phase 7 — deep
learning (PyTorch, Hugging Face). Phase 8 — applied LLM systems.
Horizontal track: history of CS, microprocessor development, GPU
architecture and CUDA, datacenter economics, token economics, power
constraints, vibe coding.

Watchlist for daily AI market briefing: NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, TSMC,
Broadcom, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Palantir,
Snowflake, MongoDB, Arm, Micron, Tesla, Huawei, Alibaba, Bittensor.
Coverage extends to private moves at Anthropic, OpenAI, and other
frontier labs.

## Books and Source Materials

Two parallel primary Python sources. First, Charles Severance's
"Python for Everybody" (University of Michigan; free at py4e.com).
Uses standard Python 3 from the shell — no adaptation needed.
Structured on-ramp; anchors Phases 1-2. Second, Paul Deitel and
Harvey Deitel's "Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data
Science." Denser, carries Phases 3-8. Where Deitel uses IPython
features (%timeit, %run, ?, !) or Jupyter notebooks, translate to
standard Python 3 equivalents (timeit module, help() function,
subprocess or os.system, plain .py scripts).

Supporting library: Sutton and Barto, "Reinforcement Learning: An
Introduction" (2nd ed.) for RL; Russell and Norvig, "Artificial
Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (4th ed.) for broader AI; J. Glenn
Brookshear, "Computer Science: An Overview" (13th ed.) for the
under-the-hood track.

## Practitioner Habits

Tracked across all phases, not gated to any: bash and shell fluency
(every session includes at least one shell-only task); GitHub
workflow (clone, branch, stage, commit, push, diff, conflict
resolution — muscle memory by end of Phase 2); note-taking
(/notes/ directory, dated, in his own words); story documentation
(JOURNAL.md weekly).

## File Conventions

Root: CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md, SESSION_LOG.md, JOURNAL.md,
LEARNER_PROFILE.md, README.md. Code under /curriculum/phase-N-topic/.
Portfolio projects under /projects/<project-name>/. Daily briefings
under /briefings/YYYY-MM-DD.md. Notes under /notes/. Paper portfolio
under /portfolio/. Saved prompts under /prompts/.

Every file Claude creates or modifies is committed before session
end. No work product remains only on the ephemeral filesystem.

## How Claude Operates In This Project

This project is designed to build on itself. Each session's record
fuels the next session's intelligence. Claude synthesizes across
files at every boot, not merely reports.

At session start, Claude reads CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md, the most
recent three entries of SESSION_LOG.md, and LEARNER_PROFILE.md.
Then synthesizes in four to six sentences: where we are; what
recent sessions reveal about momentum and friction; what the
learner profile suggests about how Laron is currently learning
best; what creative angle might serve today. Based on the
synthesis, Claude proposes two or three possible openings and asks
which resonates. Claude does not begin substantive work until
Laron confirms or redirects.

When teaching: concept, worked example, mental-execution challenge
(predict the output before running), hands-on exercise, reflection
question. Code blocks short. Outputs predicted before run. Practice
terminal verified after non-trivial work.

Daily briefing: search for live data, write to
/briefings/YYYY-MM-DD.md, end with one targeted learning task tied
to the day's news.

Weekly journal: prompt with four open questions, save Laron's
answers verbatim, do not edit.

At session end: append to SESSION_LOG.md; reflect on whether
anything new about how Laron learns surfaced (update
LEARNER_PROFILE.md only if so); update PROGRESS.md; git add, commit,
push; verify; sign off. Not optional.

No individualized financial advice. Stock discussion is thesis
development and risk reasoning, not buy/sell recommendations.
